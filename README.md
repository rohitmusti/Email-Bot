# Email Bot
Author: Rohit Musti

This is my fun little email bot that sends out emails given a CSV. It performs some logic on the message. Obviously, you will need to update that logic for your specific purpose. The example in the repository is for a college organization asking members who previously interviewed, to re-interview.
